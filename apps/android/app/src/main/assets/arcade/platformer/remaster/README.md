## features

- all levels, menus and settings work as they do on pc
- online level browser works as expected
- android native file picker for rom selection
- controller support
- on screen/touch controls, which star haptic feedback and a run lock button, and are hidden automatically, once a controller is connected
- skip transition screens by tapping on the screen
- optimized mobile renderer
- pre-baked shader cache within the apk

## limitations

- the level editor is still completely unimplemented. tracked [here](https://github.com/mircey/super-mario-bros.-remastered-android/issues/6)
